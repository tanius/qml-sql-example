# QML SQL Example

This is a simple Qt Quick application (written in QML and C++) that shows how to use a SQLite3 database in your Qt application. It uses the classes from the [Qt SQL module](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtsql-index.html), which is part of the standard Qt library.

If you are looking for an equivalent example using QWidgets rather than QML, use [QtSqlExample](https://github.com/vivaladav/BitsOfBytes/tree/master/howto-embed-database-in-application-with-sqlite-and-qt). It provides exactly the same functionality as this example, just with an interface using QWidgets.


## History and Credits

This project is based on vivaladav's application [QtSqlExample](https://github.com/vivaladav/BitsOfBytes/tree/master/howto-embed-database-in-application-with-sqlite-and-qt), which he also explains in detail in his blog post [How to embed a database in your application with SQLite and Qt](http://blog.davidecoppola.com/2016/11/howto-embed-database-in-application-with-sqlite-and-qt/).
